A junior colleague went on vacation and handed over a half-done application for you to finish. Your task is to finish the application and leave a review with comments for the colleague, to help him learn. Feel free to refactor anything you deem appropriate.

This is a basic TODO list application. Requirements are as such:
- Should keep a list of tasks which can be "active" and "completed"
- New task is added as "active"
- Clicking on "active" task marks it as "completed" by crossing it out
- Should show a total count of all tasks in the list
- Name for a new task is specified by typing in an input field

If there is anything unclear about the exact requirements, use your best judgement.
Styling of the application is not important, and there will be no additional benefit in extending the application beyond the original requirements.

To start the app:
```
npm install && npm start
```
